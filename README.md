# deep-learning-classification

## Summary

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:

Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are the features for your model?
What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?


## Final Thoughts
While it took me a lot of trial and error to get an accuracy level above 75%, I would say that is one of the most challenging parts of using this method. That and figuring out the data parameters to ensure the model fits when setting the input_dim variable, otherwise it won't be able to run the model_fit process, which then you woudl use to get teh accuracy and other stats.


Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
